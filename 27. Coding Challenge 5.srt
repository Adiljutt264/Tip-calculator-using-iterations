Jonas>Welcome back to the last and most exciting
coding challenge of this section.
So, remember the tip calculator that we created in another challenge.

Let's now create a more advanced version
using everything that we learned up until this point.

So this time, John and his family

went to five different restaurants.9
And the bills were 124, 48, 268, 180, and 42 dollars.
And again, John likes to tip 20 percent

of the bill, when it is less than 50 dollars,
50 percent if it's between 50 and 200
and 10 percent if the bill is more than 200 dollars.So, implement using objects and loops this time.So here are the steps for doing that,in order to help you.
So, first create an object with an array for the bill values.Then, add a method to calculate the tip,and this method should of course include a loop,
to iterate over all the paid bills,
and to do the tip calculations.
Then, as an output, you should again create two arrays.

One containing all the paid tips,

and two, containing all the final paid amount.So again, the bill plus the tip. Alright?
And a hint that I have to give you here
is that you can start with two empty arrays
Okay?
So an empty array is just like this here.
And you can start with two empty arrays,
one for just number one, so all the tips,
and then two, for all the final paid amounts.
So start with these two as empty arrays
and then in a loop, you can fill them up.
And that is, that Mark's family also went on a holiday.

And they are going to four different restaurants.

And the bill that they paid were

77, 375, 110, and 45 dollars.
And Mark has a slightly different
rules when it comes to tipping.
So he likes to tip 20 percent,if the bill is less than 100 dollars,10 percent, when the bill is between 100 and 300 dollars,and 25 percent if the bill is more than 300 dollars.
00:02:17,873  -->  00:02:20,047
So again, that doesn't make much sense maybe,
55

55

00:02:20,047  -->  00:02:23,179
but that's just again, to make it a bit more exciting,
56

56

00:02:23,179  -->  00:02:25,178
and to make these two tipping functions
57

57

00:02:25,178  -->  00:02:28,177
different for each of the persons.
58

58

00:02:28,177  -->  00:02:29,010
Okay?
59

59

00:02:29,010  -->  00:02:30,269
So, I want you to implement the same
60

60

00:02:30,269  -->  00:02:33,114
functionality as before, but this time of course,
61

61

00:02:33,114  -->  00:02:34,890
using Mark's tipping rules.
62

62

00:02:34,890  -->  00:02:38,019
Then create a function, and I don't mean a method.
63

63

00:02:38,019  -->  00:02:40,152
So, like an outside function to calculate
64

64

00:02:40,152  -->  00:02:43,455
the average of a given array of tips.
65

65

00:02:43,455  -->  00:02:45,264
And here I have to give you another hint,
66

66

00:02:45,264  -->  00:02:46,367
because up until this point,
67

67

00:02:46,367  -->  00:02:48,311
we never did anything like this.
68

68

00:02:48,311  -->  00:02:51,237
Okay and so I give you a hint here to calculate the average.
69

69

00:02:51,237  -->  00:02:53,631
And that is that you should loop over the array,
70

70

00:02:53,631  -->  00:02:56,467
and in each iteration, store the current sum
71

71

00:02:56,467  -->  00:02:59,050
in a variable which starts from zero.
72

72

00:02:59,050  -->  00:03:00,960
Then after you have the sum of the array,
73

73

00:03:00,960  -->  00:03:02,280
then you'll simply divide it by
74

74

00:03:02,280  -->  00:03:04,312
the number of elements in it.
75

75

00:03:04,312  -->  00:03:07,326
Okay? So that's the formula for calculating averages.
76

76

00:03:07,326  -->  00:03:09,006
So if that's a bit too difficult for you,
77

77

00:03:09,006  -->  00:03:13,046
then you can just stop maybe after point five.
78

78

00:03:13,046  -->  00:03:13,879
Okay?
79

79

00:03:13,879  -->  00:03:15,831
But I would like you to try out,
80

80

00:03:15,831  -->  00:03:17,641
to calculate the average, alright?
81

81

00:03:17,641  -->  00:03:20,006
So that's here on number seven,
82

82

00:03:20,006  -->  00:03:21,295
so you use the function that you
83

83

00:03:21,295  -->  00:03:22,883
created in number six to actually
84

84

00:03:22,883  -->  00:03:25,463
calculate the average for both families.
85

85

00:03:25,463  -->  00:03:27,016
And then you'll log to the console
86

86

00:03:27,016  -->  00:03:30,328
which family paid the highest tips on average.
87

87

00:03:30,328  -->  00:03:31,161
Alright?
88

88

00:03:31,161  -->  00:03:33,054
So, again, this one is a bit tricky maybe,
89

89

00:03:33,054  -->  00:03:36,536
so you can, no problem, take an hour or even more
90

90

00:03:36,536  -->  00:03:39,135
to try to accomplish this, alright?
91

91

00:03:39,135  -->  00:03:40,782
I think it's really important for your
92

92

00:03:40,782  -->  00:03:42,530
learning process to go through
93

93

00:03:42,530  -->  00:03:44,488
something like this, a bit more difficult even,
94

94

00:03:44,488  -->  00:03:46,045
so that you really have to try,
95

95

00:03:46,045  -->  00:03:47,730
instead of it being super easy.
96

96

00:03:47,730  -->  00:03:50,567
Because then you don't really learn anything, okay?
97

97

00:03:50,567  -->  00:03:52,172
So take an hour or something like that to
98

98

00:03:52,172  -->  00:03:54,102
really go through this and really try
99

99

00:03:54,102  -->  00:03:55,633
to solve these problems.
100

100

00:03:55,633  -->  00:03:57,788
Alright? You don't need to be fast.
101

101

00:03:57,788  -->  00:03:59,447
Then if there are some parts that
102

102

00:03:59,447  -->  00:04:01,103
you cannot figure out, again, no problem,
103

103

00:04:01,103  -->  00:04:05,520
you can just check out my solution in the next video.
